            <p>Ken cleaned 3 bedrooms of carpet before we moved into our new home we just bought. What an excellent job he did at a very reasonable rate.</p>

        <div class="testiomialscont">
            <p>I would like to thank you for making my old carpets look brand new! I have never seen such a great job!  I hired you because of allergy problems I have been plagued with for more than a year...I now have 'new looking' carpets. Prior to his cleaning, I was seriously thinking about removing old, tired, stained carpets, but no need to now.  Ken said that if I had my carpets cleaned at least once a year, the carpets would last for years.</p>

            <p>We were very pleased with the reasonable price, and Ken was even able to work us into his schedule to clean the carpets right after we accepted the estimate. Ken was very thorough and the whole process from start to finish took around 1 hour. Our carpets look great and my wife and I could not be happier with his service. We will definitely use him again and recommend him to others.</p>

            <p> Thank you - what a pleasure to do business with a company that knows what customer service is all about. You will definitely get referrals from us. You've got it right - just don't change!</p>
